      <description>What is the Math Team? The DHS Math Team is a member of the Fairfield County Math League. We hold weekly practices and compete in a county-wide competition once every month.
How to Join There is no application process for the math team, anyone is welcome! Simply come to room B111 after school on Wednesday to get started.
Keep in mind that the first Wednesday of every month is a competition, so no practice will be held on these days and the team will meet in the math learning connections room before boarding the bus.</description>
